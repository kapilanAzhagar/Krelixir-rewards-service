Rewards & Redeem Microservices
Overview

This repository demonstrates a cloud-native, event-driven microservices architecture for managing Rewards and Redeem services in an enterprise setting (e.g., hospitality domain — Hotels, Casinos, Dining). The solution is built using Spring Boot, Kafka, and AWS-native services, designed with resiliency, scalability, and observability as first-class citizens.

The system allows customers to:

Earn rewards points through transactions across different partners (Hotel, Casino, Dining).

Redeem points securely via a Redeem Service, with real-time validation.

Ensure secure inter-service communication using OAuth2 (Client Credentials Flow).

Achieve event-driven scalability using Kafka topics for rewards and redemption workflows.

Architecture Highlights
1. Microservices

Rewards Service – Issues and manages rewards points.

Redeem Service – Handles redemption workflows and ensures validation via events.

Auth Service (Sidecar) – Provides OAuth2 token service for internal microservice communication.

2. Event-Driven Design

Apache Kafka

rewards-events → Captures reward issuance events.

redeem-events → Tracks redemption requests and outcomes.

Enables decoupled, asynchronous processing and real-time scalability.

3. Security

OAuth2 with Client Credentials Flow – Ensures secure service-to-service calls.

Tokens are issued by the Auth Service and validated in Rewards & Redeem services.

4. Resiliency

Spring Retry & Circuit Breaker (Resilience4j) for transient failures.

Caching with Redis for frequently accessed reward balances.

5. Observability

Spring Boot Actuator for health checks & metrics.

Centralized Logging via structured JSON logs.

Integrates with AWS CloudWatch or ELK stack for monitoring.

6. AWS-Native Deployment

Containerized with Docker.

Amazon ECR for image repository.

ECS / EKS or Fargate for scalable deployment.

MSK (Managed Kafka) for event backbone.

S3 for storing audit logs and batch reports.

Tech Stack

Java 17, Spring Boot 3.x

Spring Security (OAuth2 Client Credentials Flow)

Spring Data JPA + PostgreSQL (RDS/Aurora)

Redis (in-memory + AWS ElastiCache)

Kafka / AWS MSK

Docker + AWS ECR

Actuator + CloudWatch/ELK

Local Setup (Developer Mode)
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/rewards-redeem-service.git
cd rewards-redeem-service

2. Build & Run
mvn clean package
mvn spring-boot:run -pl rewards-service -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev
mvn spring-boot:run -pl redeem-service -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev

3. Run with Docker (Optional)
docker build -t rewards-service ./rewards-service
docker build -t redeem-service ./redeem-service

4. API Testing (via Postman)

Rewards API → http://localhost:8080/api/rewards

Redeem API → http://localhost:8081/api/redeem

OAuth2 Token → http://localhost:9000/oauth/token

Deployment to AWS

Build Docker images and tag for ECR.

docker build -t rewards-service ./rewards-service
docker tag rewards-service:latest <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/rewards-service:latest
aws ecr get-login-password --region <region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com
docker push <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/rewards-service:latest


Repeat for Redeem Service.

Deploy via ECS (Fargate) or EKS with service discovery.

Configure MSK cluster for Kafka topics.

Use CloudWatch dashboards for monitoring.
